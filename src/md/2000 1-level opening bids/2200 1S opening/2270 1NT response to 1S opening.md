### <a name="1NT_response_to_1S_opening"> {1NT} response to {1S} opening

When responder has ca. 6-11 HCP and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a non-forcing response of {1NT}.

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener is minimum, they can pass (though they might prefer to bid with a very unbalanced hand). Otherwise, opener should rebid as follows:

- {2C} shows 4+ clubs and exactly 4 spades (therefore 5+ clubs unless opener has a 4=1=4=4 hand).
- {2D} shows 5+ diamonds and exactly 4 spades. (With a 4=1=4=4 hand, opener would rebid {2C}.)
- Note that after a {1S} opening bid and {1NT} response, opener cannot need to show a heart suit with 4+ cards: with 4+ cards in both majors, they would have opened {1H} rather than {1S}. Therefore the {2H} rebid can be used for another purpose.
- {2H} shows 5+ spades and 4+ cards in an undisclosed minor (but does not promise equal-or-longer spades, e.g. opener could be 5=1=1=6).
    - Responder's {2NT} rebid now asks opener to bid their undisclosed minor. (With a 5=0=4=4 hand, opener will bid the cheaper minor, i.e. {3C}.)
- {2S} shows 6+ spades and denies 4+ cards in either minor.
- {2NT} shows a 5332 hand.

Responder should rarely pass with an invitiational hand (ca. 9-11 HCP), though they might do so if they suspect a misfit.

If opener has a very strong hand, they can rebid as above but a level higher, which is encouraging but not forcing.
