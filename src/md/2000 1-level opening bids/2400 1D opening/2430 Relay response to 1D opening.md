### <a name="Relay_response_to_1D_opening"> Relay response to {1D} opening

When responder has ca. 7+ HCP - or ca. 6 HCP or less and no 5+ card suit - they should make a relay response of {1H}.

(If they have invitational strength if opener has a 10-12 HCP hand - ca. 13-14 HCP - and a balanced hand without a 4-card or longer major, they should generally prefer to invite game by [responding {1NT}](#1NT_response_to_1D_opening) instead.)

If opener has a 10-12 HCP hand, they should rebid {1S}. Responder then rebids as follows:

- With ca. 6 HCP or less and no 5+ card suit, they should bid {1NT}. Opener must pass.
- With a less-than-invitational hand (ca. 7-12 HCP):
    - With no 5+ card major (or 6+ card minor), they should bid {1NT}. Opener must pass.
    - With 5+ spades, they should pass.
    - With 5+ hearts, they should transfer (with {2D}, as over a {1NT} opening bid) and pass opener's forced {2H} rebid.
    - With a 6+ card minor, if they feel that {3C} or {3D} will be better than {1NT}, they can transfer (with {2S} for clubs or {2NT} for diamonds, as over a {1NT} opening bid) and pass opener's forced rebid
- Otherwise, responder's rebids are analogous to the [responses to a 1NT opening bid](#Responses_to_1NT_opening) (albeit taking into account that opener's point range is 10-12 HCP, not 13-15 HCP).

If opener has a 16-18 HCP hand, they should rebid {1NT}. Responder's rebids are analogous to the [responses to a 1NT opening bid](#Responses_to_1NT_opening) (albeit taking into account that opener's point range is 16-18 HCP, not 13-15 HCP).
