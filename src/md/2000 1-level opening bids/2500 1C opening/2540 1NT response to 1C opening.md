### <a name="1NT_response_to_1C_opening"> {1NT} response to {1C} opening

When responder has ca. 6-11 HCP, they should make a non-forcing response of {1NT}.

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener is minimum, they can pass (though they might prefer to bid with a very unbalanced hand). Otherwise, opener should rebid as follows:

- {2C} shows a single-suited hand with 6+ clubs.
- {2D} shows a single-suited hand with 6+ diamonds.
- {2H} shows both minors with longer diamonds (i.e. at least 4-5 in clubs and diamonds).
- {2S} shows both minors with equal or longer clubs (i.e. at least 5-4 in clubs and diamonds).
- {2NT} shows a balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hand with 19-21 HCP.

Responder should rarely pass opener's {2C}, {2D}, {2H} or {2S} rebids with an invitiational hand (ca. 9-11 HCP), though they might do so if they suspect a misfit. (They should never pass if opener rebids {2NT}.)

If opener has a very strong and unbalanced hand, they can rebid as above but a level higher, which is encouraging but not forcing. (There is no need to jump rebid when they have a balanced hand with 19-21 HCP.)
