### <a name="Pre-emptive_responses_to_1H_opening"> Pre-emptive responses to {1H} opening

When responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ hearts, they should make a pre-emptive raise in hearts:

- With a "weak freak" - 6+ hearts and a singleton or void - they should bid {4H}.
- With 5+ hearts - and ideally a singleton or void when vulnerable - they should bid {3H}.
- With exactly 4 hearts - or 5+ but no singleton or void - they should bid {2H}.

(However, with a very weak hand, exactly 4 hearts, and no singleton or void, they should usually pass.)

Opener will usually pass the pre-emptive raise; with a strong hand, they might be able to bid {4H} - or, if interested in game following a {2H} response, they can:

- Bid a new suit at the cheapest level (i.e. {2S}, {3C} or {3D}) to show a weak suit where they fear too many quick losers.
    - If responder has a 1-loser holding in the suit, they bid {4H}; otherwise, they bid {3H}.
- Bid {3H} to show poor quality hearts (e.g. something like T9643).
    - If responder has two honours in hearts, they bid {4H}; otherwise, they pass.
