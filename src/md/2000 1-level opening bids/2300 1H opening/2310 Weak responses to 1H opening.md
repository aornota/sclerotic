### <a name="Weak_responses_to_1H_opening"> Weak responses to {1H} opening

When responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than hearts, they should make a weak response of {2C}, {2D} or {2S}. (These are analogous to weak jump responses in a standard system.)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel that playing in their long suit will be better).

##### An example

A very weak hand with long diamonds that should make a weak response of {2D}:
