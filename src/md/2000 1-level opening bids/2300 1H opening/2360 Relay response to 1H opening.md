### <a name="Relay_response_to_1H_opening"> Relay response to {1H} opening

When responder has a game-forcing hand - ca. 12+ HCP - and fewer than 4 hearts, they should make a relay response of {1S}.

Opener rebids as follows:

- {1NT} shows either a three-suited hand (4441 or 5440) or a 5322 hand.
    - Responder then relays with {2C} and opener rebids as follows:
        - {2D} shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in spades.
        - {2H} shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in diamonds.
        - {2S} shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in clubs.
        - {2NT} shows a 5332 hand.
- {2C} shows clubs with equal or longer hearts (i.e. at least 5-4 in hearts and clubs).
- {2D} shows diamonds with equal or longer hearts (i.e. at least 5-4 in hearts and diamonds).
- {2H} shows a single-suited hand with 6+ hearts.
- {2S} shows spades with equal or longer hearts (i.e. at least 5-4 in hearts and spades).
- {2NT} shows longer spades (i.e. at least 4-5 in hearts and spades).
- {3C} shows longer clubs (i.e. at least 4-5 in hearts and clubs).
- {3D} shows longer diamonds (i.e. at least 4-5 in hearts and diamonds).
