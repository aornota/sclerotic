### <a name="1NT_response_to_1H_opening"> {1NT} response to {1H} opening

When responder has ca. 6-11 HCP and fewer than 4 hearts, they should make a non-forcing response of {1NT}.

(Note that this response does not promise a balanced hand.)

If opener is minimum, they can pass (though they might prefer to bid with a very unbalanced hand). Otherwise, opener should rebid as follows:

- {2C}, {2D}, and {2S} show 4+ cards in the suit bid.
    - Note that as {2S} is a reverse - rebidding a higher-ranking suit at a higher-level, such that responder is forced to the 3-level if they want to show a preference for hearts - opener should have considerably more than a minimum hand and/or a very unbalanced hand. (With an intermediate hand with 5+ hearts and 4+ spades, opener should just rebid {2H}.)
- {2H} shows 5+ hearts and denies 4+ cards in either minor (therefore at least 6+ hearts unless opener has exactly 5 hearts and 4+ spades but insufficient strength to reverse).
- {2NT} shows a 5332 hand.

Responder should rarely pass with an invitiational hand (ca. 9-11 HCP), though they might do so if they suspect a misfit.

If opener has a very strong hand, they can rebid as above but a level higher, which is encouraging but not forcing.
