### <a name="1NT_response_to_1D_opening"> {1NT} response to {1D} opening

When responder has invitational strength if opener has a 10-12 HCP hand - ca. 13-14 HCP - and a balanced hand (usually without a 4-card or longer major), they can invite game by responding {1NT}.

(When responder has a 4-card or longer major, they should generally prefer to make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1D_opening) instead, then make a Stayman or transfer bid.)

If opener has a 10-12 HCP hand, they should rebid {3NT} with a maximum and pass otherwise.

If opener has a 15-17 HCP hand, they should rebid {3NT} (or explore for a thin slam).
