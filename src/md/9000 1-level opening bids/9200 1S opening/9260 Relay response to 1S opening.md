### <a name="Relay_response_to_1S_opening"> Relay response to {1S} opening

When responder has a game-forcing hand - ca. 12+ HCP - and fewer than 4 spades, they should make a relay response of {2C}.

Opener rebids as follows:

- {2D} shows either a three-suited hand (4441 or 5440) with a singleton or void in hearts or a 5322 hand.
    - Responder then relays with {2H} and opener rebids as follows:
        - {2S} shows a three-suited hand with a singleton or void in hearts.
        - {2NT} shows a 5332 hand.
- {2H} shows clubs with equal or longer spades (i.e. at least 5-4 in spades and clubs).
- {2S} shows a single-suited hand with 6+ spades.
- {2NT} shows diamonds with equal or longer spades (i.e. at least 5-4 in spades and diamonds).
- {3C} shows longer clubs (i.e. at least 4-5 in spades and clubs).
- {3D} shows longer diamonds (i.e. at least 4-5 in spades and diamonds).
