### <a name="Weak_responses_to_1S_opening"> Weak responses to {1S} opening

When responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than spades, they should make a weak response of {2D}, {2H} or {3C}. (These are analogous to weak jump responses in a standard system.)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel that playing in their long suit will be better).

##### An example

A very weak hand with long hearts that should make a weak response of {2H}:

> {| s:3 h:KT975432 d:862 c:5 --shape --hcp |}
