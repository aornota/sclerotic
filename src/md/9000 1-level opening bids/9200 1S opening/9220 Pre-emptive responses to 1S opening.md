### <a name="Pre-emptive_responses_to_1S_opening"> Pre-emptive responses to {1S} opening

When responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ spades, they should make a pre-emptive raise in spades:

- With a "weak freak" - 6+ spades and a singleton or void - they should bid {4S}.
- With 5+ spades - and ideally a singleton or void when vulnerable - they should bid {3S}.
- With exactly 4 spades - or 5+ but no singleton or void - they should bid {2S}.

(However, with a very weak hand, exactly 4 spades, and no singleton or void, they should usually pass.)

Opener will usually pass the pre-emptive raise; with a strong hand, they might be able to bid {4S} - or, if interested in game following a {2S} response, they can:

- Bid a new suit at the cheapest level (i.e. {3C}, {3D} or {3H}) to show a weak suit where they fear too many quick losers.
    - If responder has a 1-loser holding in the suit, they bid {4S}; otherwise, they bid {3S}.
- Bid {3S} to show poor quality spades (e.g. something like T9643).
    - If responder has two honours in spades, they bid {4S}; otherwise, they pass.
