## <a name="1H_opening"> {1H} opening

All unbalanced hands (and the occasional 5332 hand) with ca. 11-19 HCP and with 4+ hearts are opened {1H}.

Note that these hands might have a longer (or equal length) spade suit and/or a longer (or equal length) minor suit.

A {1H} opening bid is not forcing.

#### Responses to {1H} opening

If responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) other than hearts - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they should make a [weak response](#Weak_responses_to_1H_opening) ({2C}, {2D} or {2S}).

If responder has a weak hand (ca. 6 HCP or less) with 4+ hearts, they should make a [pre-emptive response](#Pre-emptive_responses_to_1H_opening) ({2H}, {3H} or {4H}) - or pass with a very weak hand with exactly 4 hearts and no singleton or void.

If responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 7-11 HCP, they should make a [Bergen response](#Bergen_responses_to_1H_opening) ({3C} or {3D}).

If responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 12+ HCP, they should make a [Jacoby {2NT} response](#Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1H_opening) - or, with a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace) they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1H_opening) instead ({3S}, {4C} or {4D}).

If responder has a game-forcing hand - ca. 12+ HCP - and fewer than 4 hearts, they should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1H_opening) ({1S}).

If responder has ca. 6-11 HCP and fewer than 4 hearts, they should [respond {1NT}](#1NT_response_to_1H_opening).

// TODO-NMB: What about {3NT} ("pudding") and {4S} (Kickback) responses?...

Otherwise, responder should pass.
