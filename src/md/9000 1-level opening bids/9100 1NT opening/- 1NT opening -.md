## <a name="1NT_opening"> {1NT} opening

All balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hands with 13-15 HCP should be opened {1NT} - except that a 5332 hand with a 5-card major can be opened [{1S}](#1S_opening) or [{1H}](#1H_opening) if it does not feel "no-trumpy", e.g. if values are concentrated in the major.

A {1NT} opening bid is not forcing.

By partnership agreement, you might also open {1NT} (rather than [{1D}](#1D_opening)) with the best 12 HCP balanced hands.

##### Some examples

A balanced hand with 14 HCP and scattered honours that should be opened {1NT}:

> {| s:84 h:AQJ6 d:Q932 c:KQ7 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with a "good" 12 HCP - decent 5-card suit with good intermediates and 2 quick tricks  - that could be opened {1NT} by partnership agreement:

> {| s:A9 h:J84 d:QT2 c:AJT97 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with a "bad" 12 HCP - 4333 and "quacky" with poor intermediates and only 1 quick trick - that should be opened [{1D}](#1D_opening) instead:

> {| s:QJ2 h:J82 d:QJ63 c:KQ5 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with 15 HCP and a 5-card major that should be opened {1NT}:

> {| s:AJ h:QJ763 d:AT2 c:K98 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with 13 HCP and values concentrated in the 5-card major that could be opened [{1S}](#1S_opening) instead:

> {| s:AKQJ9 h:43 d:762 c:QJ2 --shape --hcp |}
