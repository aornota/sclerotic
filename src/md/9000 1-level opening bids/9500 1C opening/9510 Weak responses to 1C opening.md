### <a name="Weak_responses_to_1C_opening"> Weak responses to {1C} opening

When responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards), they should make a weak response of {1S}, {2C}, {2D} or {2H}. (These are analogous to weak jump responses in a standard system.)

Opener should usually pass, though may choose to do otherwise with a strong hand and a good fit for responder's long suit (or if they feel that playing in their long minor will be better).

##### Some examples

A very weak hand with long spades that should make a weak response of {1S}:

> {| s:QT87542 h:32 d:J3 c:96 --shape --hcp |}

A weak hand with strength concentrated in the long suit that should make a weak response of {2C}:

> {| s:J32 h:64 d:87 c:KQT975 --shape --hcp |}
