### <a name="Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1H_opening"> Jacoby {2NT} response to {1H} opening

When responder has 4+ hearts and ca. 12+ HCP, they should make a game-forcing response of {2NT}.

(However, with a singleton or void - but not a singleton Ace - they might prefer a [splinter response](#Splinter_responses_to_1H_opening) instead.)

Opener rebids as follows:

- A new suit at the 3-level shows a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace).
- A new suit at the 4-level shows a good suit (ideally 5+ cards and at least two of the top three honours).
    - Note that after a {1H} opening bid and {2NT} response, opener cannot show a good spade suit as {4S} takes the auction beyond {4H}. ({4S} would be RKCB for hearts if the partnership plays Kickback.)
- {3H} shows a strong hand with 5+ hearts.
- {3NT} shows a strong hand with exactly 4 hearts.
- {4H} shows a minimum hand.
