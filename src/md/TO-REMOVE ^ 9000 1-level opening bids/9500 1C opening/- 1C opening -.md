## <a name="1C_opening"> {1C} opening

All unbalanced hands with ca. 11-19 HCP and without a 4-card or longer major suit - and all balanced (4333, 4432 or 5332) hands with 19-21 HCP - are opened {1C}.

(As usual, a 5332 hand with 19-21 HCP and a 5-card major can be opened [{1S}](#1S_opening) or [{1H}](#1H_opening) if it does not feel "no-trumpy" - though with 19-21 HCP, that is unlikely.)

A {1C} opening bid is forcing.

##### Some examples

A minimum unbalanced hand with both minors that should be opened {1C}:

> {| s:2 h:J87 d:AT83 c:AQT93 --shape --hcp |}

A very unbalanced hand with long diamonds that should be opened {1C}:

> {| s:T62 h:AK d:AQ765432 c:- --shape --hcp |}

A strong unbalanced hand with long clubs that should be opened {1C}:

> {| s:KQ3 h:8 d:Q43 c:AKQ842 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with 19 HCP that should be opened {1C}:

> {| s:A765 h:KQ2 d:KJ65 c:AQ --shape --hcp |}

#### Responses to {1C} opening

If responder has a weak hand with a long suit (ideally 7+ cards) - such that their hand is essentially worthless unless their suit is the trump suit - they should make a [weak response](#Weak_responses_to_1C_opening) ({1S}, {2C}, {2D} or {2H}).

If responder has a weak hand - ca. 5 HCP of less - and no long suit, they should make a [negative response](#Negative_response_to_1C_opening) ({1D}).

If responder has game-forcing hand - ca. 12+ HCP - they should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1C_opening) ({1H}).

If responder has ca. 6-11 HCP, they should [respond {1NT}](#1NT_response_to_1c_opening).
