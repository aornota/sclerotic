### <a name="Negative_response_to_1C_opening"> Negative response to {1C} opening

When responder has a very weak hand - ca. 5 HCP or less - and no long suit, they should make a negative response of {1D}.

Opener rebids as follows:

- With 5+ diamonds, they pass. (This will occasionally mean playing in a 5- or 6-card diamond fit. Can't win 'em all.)
- With exactly 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, they rebid {1H}. (Note that since they would not have opened {1C} with a 4-card major, they cannot have a major suit void: with 4=0=4=5 or 0=4=4=5, they would have opened {1S} or {1H} respectively.) Responder then rebids as follows:
    - With 6+ hearts (therefore at least a 7-card fit) and no 9-card or longer minor suit fit, they pass.
    - With 6+ spades (therefore at least a 7-card fit) and no 9-card or longer minor suit fit, they bid {1S}. Opener must pass.
    - With at least a 7-card fit in one or both minors, they bid the longer fit (i.e. {2D} or {2C}). Opener must pass.
    - Otherwise, they bid {1NT}. Opener must pass.
- With a balanced hand and 19-21 HCP, they rebid {1NT}. Responder will often pass, though they can use garbage Stayman or transfers (as over a {1NT} opening bid) as appropriate - or even invite game (via Stayman or a transfer) with 4-5 HCP.
- With 6+ clubs, they rebid {2C}. Responder must pass.
