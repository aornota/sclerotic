### <a name="Splinter_responses_to_1S_opening"> Splinter responses to {1S} opening

When responder has 4+ spades, ca. 12+ HCP, and a singleton or void (but not a singleton Ace), they should make a game-forcing double-jump response:

- {4C} shows a singleton or void in clubs.
- {4D} shows a singleton or void in diamonds.
- {4H} shows a singleton or void in hearts.

(However, by partnership agreement, a strong responder might prefer a [Jacoby {2NT} response](#Jacoby_2NT_response_to_1S_opening) instead, e.g. if they want to find out more about opener's hand rather than telling opener about their singleton or void.)
