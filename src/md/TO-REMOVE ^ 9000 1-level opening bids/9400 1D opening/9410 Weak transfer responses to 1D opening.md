### <a name="Weak_transfer_responses_to_1D_opening"> Weak transfer responses to {1D} opening

When responder has less-than-invitational strength even if opener has a 16-18 HCP hand - ca. 6 HCP or less - and has 5+ cards in a suit other than diamonds, they can make a weak transfer response and then pass opener's forced rebid, as follows:

- With 5+ clubs, they respond {1S} and opener is forced to rebid {2C}.
- With 5+ hearts, they respond {2D} and opener is forced to rebid {2H}.
- With 5+ spades, they respond {2H} and opener is forced to rebid {2S}.

(Note that with 5+ cards in a major suit, the transfer response is the same as over a {1NT} opening bid. Although responder could relay with {1H} and then transfer, transferring immediately is preferable: relaying would leak information about opener's HCP range - and would also be more vulnerable to interference.)

As mentioned above, with 5+ diamonds, responder can just pass the {1D} opening bid.

##### An example

A less-than-invitational hand with 5+ clubs that should make a weak transfer response of {1S}, then pass opener's forced {2C} rebid:
