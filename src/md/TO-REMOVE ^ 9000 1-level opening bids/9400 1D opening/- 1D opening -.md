## <a name="1D_opening"> {1D} opening

All balanced (4333, 4432 or 5332) hands with either 10-12 HCP or 16-18 HCP should be opened {1D} - except that a 5332 hand with 16-18 HCP and a 5-card major can be opened [{1S}](#1S_opening) or [{1H}](#1H_opening) if it does not feel "no-trumpy", e.g. if values are concentrated in the major.

(A 5332 hand with 10-12 HCP and a 5-card major will rarely satisfy the "rule of 20" and should almost always be opened {1D}.)

By partnership agreement, you might decide only to open the 10-12 HCP hands in some circumstances, e.g. only when non-vulnerable or only at favourable vulnerability. You might also decide to open [{1NT}](#1NT_opening) instead with the best 12 HCP balanced hands.

A {1D} opening bid is forcing (with one exception).

##### Some examples

A balanced hand with 10 HCP that should be opened {1D}:

> {| s:A7 h:QJ5 d:J9872 c:Q54 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with a "bad" 12 HCP - 4333 and "quacky" with poor intermediates and only 1 quick trick - that should be opened {1D}:

> {| s:QJ2 h:J82 d:QJ63 c:KQ5 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with a "good" 12 HCP - decent 5-card suit with good intermediates and 2 quick tricks  - that could be opened [{1NT}](#1NT_opening) instead by partnership agreement:

> {| s:A9 h:J84 d:QT2 c:AJT97 --shape --hcp |}

A balanced hand with 17 HCP that should be opened {1D}:

> {| s:AJ74 h:Q9 d:AK87 c:QJ3 --shape --hcp |}

#### Responses to {1D} opening

If responder has less-than-invitational strength even if opener has a 16-18 HCP hand - ca. 6 HCP or less - and has 5+ diamonds, they should pass.

If responder has ca. 6 HCP or less and a different 5+ card suit, they should make a [weak transfer response](#Weak_transfer_responses_to_1D_opening) ({1S}, {2D} or {2H}).

If responder has invitational strength if opener has a 10-12 HCP hand - ca. 13-14 HCP - and a balanced hand (usually without a 4-card or longer major), they can invite game by [responding {1NT}](#1NT_response_to_1D_opening).

Otherwise, responder should make a [relay response](#Relay_response_to_1D_opening) ({1H}).
