Sclerotic is an experimental "strong club" Bridge bidding system.

It has the following notable features:

- All hands with 16+ HCP are opened {1C}.
- Balanced (4333, 4432 or 5332) hands with 13-15 HCP are opened {1NT} - except that if they contain a 5-card major, they are opened {1H} or {1S}.
- Most unbalanced hands with 11-15 HCP are opened {1D}, {1H}, {1S} or {2C}. These bids promise 4+ diamonds / 5+ hearts / 5+ spades / 6+ clubs respectively.
- "Problem" unbalanced hands with 11-15 HCP - i.e. those not meeting the minimum suit length restrictions to be opened {1D}, {1H}, {1S} or {2C} - are opened {2D}. The hand shape will be one of 4=4=1=4 / 4=4=0=5 / 4=3=1=5 / 3=4=1=5 / 4=2=2=5 / 2=4=2=5.
- Opening bids higher than {2D} are almost always pre-emptive. (The {2NT} opening can be semi-constructive, depending on vulnerability.)

Note that HCP ranges are not set in stone, e.g. a balanced hand with a "good 12" HCP could be opened {1NT} (rather than passed) and a balanced hand with a "bad 16" HCP could also be opened {1NT} (rather than {1C}). Similarly, a very shapely hand with fewer than 16 HCP could be opened {1C}. There's no substitute for judgement.

To summarize the 1- and 2-level openings bids:

- [{1C}](#-strong-1c-opening-bid) shows a hand with 16+ HCP. This bid is forcing.
- [{1D}](#-1d-opening-bid) shows a hand with 11-15 HCP and 4+ diamonds. This bid is not forcing.
- [{1H}](#-1h-opening-bid) shows a hand with 11-15 HCP and 5+ hearts (including 5332 hands with 13-15 HCP). This bid is not forcing.
- [{1S}](#-1s-opening-bid) shows a hand with 11-15 HCP and 5+ spades (including 5332 hands with 13-15 HCP). This bid is not forcing.
- [{1NT}](#-1nt-opening-bid) shows a balanced (4333, 4432 or 5332) hand with 13-15 HCP but without a 5-card major. This bid is not forcing.
- [{2C}](#-2c-opening-bid) shows a hand with 11-15 HCP and 6+ clubs. This bid is not forcing.
- [{2D}](#-2d-opening-bid) shows a hand with 11-15 HCP and 4=4=1=4 / 4=4=0=5 / 4=3=1=5 / 3=4=1=5 / 4=2=2=5 / 2=4=2=5 shape. This bid is forcing (with one exception).
- [{2H}](#-2h-opening-bid) shows a hand with 6-10 HCP and (usually) 6 hearts. This bid is not forcing.
- [{2S}](#-2s-opening-bid) shows a hand with 6-10 HCP and (usually) 6 spades. This bid is not forcing.
- [{2NT}](#-2nt-opening-bid) shows a hand with 5+ clubs and 5+ diamonds. The HCP range varies according to vulnerability and seat. This bid is forcing (with one exception).
