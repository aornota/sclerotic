# <a name="Strong_(1C)_opening_bid"> Strong (1C) opening bid

The {1C} opening bid shows any hand with 16+ HCP. Responder should bid as follows (assuming that RHO has passed):

With 0-8 HCP and no 7+ card suit, bid [{1D}](#1D_response-to-1C-opening-bid). This bid forces opener to make at least one more bid (assuming that LHO passes).

With 0-8 HCP and 7+ card suit, bid [the suit at the 3- or 4-level](#Other-responses-to-1C-opening-bid). This bid is not forcing.

With 9+ HCP, choose one of the following bids - all of which establish a game-force - depending on shape:

- With a balanced (4333, 4432, and 5332) hand, bid [{1H}](#-1h-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a three-suited (4441 or 5440) hand, bid [{1S}](#-1s-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a single-suiter in clubs (6+ clubs and no other 4+ card suit) - or with a two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer clubs - bid [{1NT}](#-1nt-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a single-suiter in diamonds (6+ diamonds and no other 4+ card suit) - or with a two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer diamonds - bid [{2C}](#-2c-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a single-suiter in hearts (6+ hearts and no other 4+ card suit) - or with a two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer-or-equal hearts - bid [{2D}](#-2d-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a single-suiter in spades (6+ spades and no other 4+ card suit) - or with a spades-and-clubs or spades-and-diamonds two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer-or-equal spades - bid [{2H}](#-2h-response-to-1c-opening).
-- Note that the {2H} response does not include a two-suiter with spades and hearts. (With longer-or-equal hearts, the response is {2D}; with longer spades, the response is {2NT}.)
- With a two-suiter with equal length in clubs and diamonds, bid [{2S}](#-2s-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a two-suiter in hearts and spades with longer spades, bid [{2NT}](#-2nt-response-to-1c-opening).
