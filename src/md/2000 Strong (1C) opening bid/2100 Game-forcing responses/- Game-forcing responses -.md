## <a name="Game-forcing_responses_to_1C_opening_bid"> Game-forcing reponses to 1C opening bid

If opener's LHO passes after a {1C} opening bid and responder has 9+ HCP, they should choose one of the following bids - all of which are forcing to game - depending on shape:

- With a balanced (4333, 4432 or 5332) hand, bid [{1H}](#-1h-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a three-suited (4441 or 5440) hand, bid [{1S}](#-1s-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a single-suiter in clubs (6+ clubs and no other 4+ card suit) - or with a two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer clubs - bid [{1NT}](#-1nt-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a single-suiter in diamonds (6+ diamonds and no other 4+ card suit) - or with a two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer diamonds - bid [{2C}](#-2c-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a single-suiter in hearts (6+ hearts and no other 4+ card suit) - or with a two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer-or-equal hearts - bid [{2D}](#-2d-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a single-suiter in spades (6+ spades and no other 4+ card suit) - or with a spades-and-clubs or spades-and-diamonds two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer-or-equal spades - bid [{2H}](#-2h-response-to-1c-opening).
  - Note that the {2H} response does not include a spades-and-hearts two-suiter. (With longer-or-equal hearts, the response is {2D}; with longer spades, the response is {2NT}.)
- With a two-suiter with equal length in clubs and diamonds, bid [{2S}](#-2s-response-to-1c-opening).
- With a two-suiter in hearts and spades with longer spades, bid [{2NT}](#-2nt-response-to-1c-opening).
