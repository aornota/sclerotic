### <a name="2H_response_to_1C_opening"> 2H response to 1C opening

The {2H} response to a {1C} opening bid shows a single-suiter in spades (6+ spades and no other 4+ card suit) - or a pades-and-clubs or spades-and-diamonds two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer-or-equal spades - with 9+ HCP. This response is forcing to game.

Note that the {2H} response does not include a spades-and-hearts two-suiter. (With longer-or-equal hearts, the response is [{2D}](#-2d-response-to-1c-opening); with longer spades, the response is [{2NT}](#-2nt-response-to-1c-opening).)
