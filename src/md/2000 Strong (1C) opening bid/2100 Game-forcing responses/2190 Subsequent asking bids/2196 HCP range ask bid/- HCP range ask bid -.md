// TODO-NMB: Will an HCP range ask bid ever be made at game level (i.e. 3NT?...

An HCP range ask bid will always made below game (i.e. {1NT} or {2NT}). Responder should bid as follows:

- 1st step: 9-10 HCP
- 2nd step: 11-12 HCP
- 3rd step: 13-14 HCP
- 4th step: 15-16 HCP
- 5th step: 17-18 HCP
- and so on

Note that if the HCP range ask bid was {2NT} and responder has 19+ HCP, their bid will be higher than {3NT}. This should not be a problem: slam will often be likely with such a strong hand opposite a strong opener.

If opener next bids {3NT} or {6NT} (or {7NT}), this is to play and responder must pass.

If opener next bids {4NT} or {5NT}, these are invites to {6NT} and {7NT} respectively. Responder should pass with the lower end of their HCP range and bid the NT slam otherwise.

_More (e.g. opener's other continuations) coming soon..._
