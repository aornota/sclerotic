// TODO-NMB: Will a suit-suggestion bid ever be made at game level?...

A suit-suggestion bid will always be made below game. Responder should bid as follows:

If the suit-suggestion bid was more than one level below game, responder should bid as follows:

- 1st step: 2-card support
- 2nd step: 3-card support without an Ace, King or Queen
- 3rd step: control count = 0 or 1
- 4th step: control count = 2
- 5th step: control count = 3
- and so on

If opener next bids the suggested suit at game level or higher, this is to play and responder must pass.

If the suit-suggestion bid was one level below game, responder should bid as follows:

- 1st step: 2-card support
- 2nd step: 3-card support without an Ace, King or Queen
- 3rd step: control count = 0 or 1
- 4th step: control count = 2
- 5th step: control count = 3 or more

If opener next bids the suggested suit, this is to play and responder must pass.

// TODO-NMB: What does opener do after a 5th step response?...
