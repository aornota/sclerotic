### <a name="Subsequent_asking_bids"> Subsequent asking bids

After a game-forcing response to a {1C} opening bid - and assusming that the opponents do not interfere - opener will almost always make an asking bid later in the auction:

- If opener wants to play a suit contact (either in a known fit or with a single-suited hand), they will make a [suit-agreement bid](#-suit-agreement-bid). This asks for responder's control count.
- If opener might want to play a suit contract (depending on responder's support for the suit), they will make a [suit-suggestion bid](#-suit-suggestion-bid). This asks for responder's support for the suit - and, with good support, for responder's control count.
- If opener wants to play an NT contract, they will make an [HCP range ask bid](#-nt-range-ask-bid). This asks for responder's HCP range.
