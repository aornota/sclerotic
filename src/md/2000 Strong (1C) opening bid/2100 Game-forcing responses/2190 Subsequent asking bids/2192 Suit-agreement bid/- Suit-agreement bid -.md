#### <a name="Suit-agreement_bid"> Suit-agreement bid

A suit-agreement bid will usually be made below game. If so, responder should bid according to their control count - where each Ace counts as 2 and each King counts as 1 - as fdllows:

- 1st step: control count = 0 or 1
- 2nd step: control count = 2
- 3rd step: control count = 3
- 4th step: control count = 4
- 5th step: control count = 5
- and so on

Note that if the suit-agreement bid was one level below game and responder has a control count of 6 or more, their bid will be higher than game in the agreed suit. This should not be a problem: slam will often be likely with such a strong hand opposite a strong opener.

If opener next bids the agreed suit at game level or higher, this is to play and responder must pass.

// TODO-NMB: Confirm how to handle game-level suit-agreement bids...

In the rare cases where a suit-agreement bid is made at the game level (i.e. {4H}, {4S}, {5C} or {5D}), responder should pass with a control count of 3 or less - and otherwise respond as follows:

- 1st step: control count = 4
- 2nd step: control count = 5
- 3rd step: control count = 6
- 4th step: control count = 7
- 5th step: control count = 8
- 6th step: control count = 9 or more

If opener next bids the agreed suit, this is to play and responder must pass.
