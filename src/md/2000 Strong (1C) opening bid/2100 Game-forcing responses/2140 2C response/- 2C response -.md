### <a name="2C_response_to_1C_opening"> 2C response to 1C opening

The {2C} response to a {1C} opening bid shows a single-suiter in diamonds (6+ diamonds and no other 4+ card suit) - or a two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer diamonds - with 9+ HCP. This response is forcing to game.

If opener's RHO bids over this reponse, see [coping with interference over game-forcing responses to {1C} opening](#-coping-with-interference-over-game-forcing-responses-to-1c-opening).
