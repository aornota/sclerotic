### <a name="1NT_response_to_1C_opening"> 1NT response to 1C opening

The {1NT} response to a {1C} opening bid shows a single-suiter in clubs (6+ clubs and no other 4+ card suit) - or a two-suiter (at least 5-4) with longer clubs - with 9+ HCP. This response is forcing to game.

If opener's RHO bids over this reponse, see [coping with interference over game-forcing responses to {1C} opening](#-coping-with-interference-over-game-forcing-responses-to-1c-opening).
