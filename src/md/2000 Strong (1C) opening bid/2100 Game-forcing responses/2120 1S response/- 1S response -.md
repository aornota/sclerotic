### <a name="1S_response_to_1C_opening"> 1S response to 1C opening

The {1S} response to a {1C} opening bid shows a three-suited (4441 or 5440) hand with 9+ HCP. This response is forcing to game.

If opener's RHO bids over this reponse, see [coping with interference over game-forcing responses to {1C} opening](#-coping-with-interference-over-game-forcing-responses-to-1c-opening).

Otherwise, opener should bid {1NT} to ask responder to bid their singleton or void at the 2-level. (Note that if opener has a single-suited hand, it is likely that responder's shortness will be in that suit. Nonetheless, even if opener's suit is strong enough to play a contract in that suit opposite a singleton or void, they should still bid {1NT} because in the rare cases where responder's shortness is in another suit, prospects for slam have improved significantly.)

Following responder's shortness-showing bid, opener will make an asking bid:

- Bidding a suit other than responder's short suit at the cheapest level is a [suit-agreement bid](#-suit-agreement-bid) and asks for responder's control count.
- Bidding responder's short suit at the 3-level is also a [suit-agreement bid](#-suit-agreement-bid) - albeit more of an imposition than an agreement, given responder's shortness in the suit - and asks for responder's control count.
  - Note that opener will need a very strong suit to play a contract in that suit opposite a singleton or void. Otherwise, they should prefer an NT contract.
- Bidding {2NT} is an [HCP range ask bid](#-nt-range-ask-bid) and asks for responder's HCP range.

##### Example auction with a suit-agreement bid

The {1C} opener has:

> {| s:AQ74 h:K8532 d:AJ c:KQ --shape --hcp --cc |}

Responder bids {1S} with:

> {| s:KJ98 h:6 d:K543 c:A962 --shape --hcp --cc |}

The auction continues as follows:

- (Opener) {1NT}: asks for shortness
- (Responder) {}:
- (Opener) {}:
- (Responder) {}:
- (Opener) {}:



// TODO-NMB: Run simulation to see how often the contract makes?...

// If opener's LHO has ♠532 ♥QJT7 ♦T8 ♣T875 and opener's RHO has ♠T6 ♥A93 ♦Q9762 ♣J43, can make 6S | 5C | 4H | 5NT (and 4D).
