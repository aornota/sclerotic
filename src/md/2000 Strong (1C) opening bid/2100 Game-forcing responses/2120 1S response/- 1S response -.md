### <a name="1S_response_to_1C_opening"> 1S response to 1C opening

The {1S} response to a {1C} opening bid shows a three-suited (4441 or 5440) hand with 9+ HCP. This response is forcing to game.

If opener's RHO bids over this reponse, see [coping with interference over game-forcing responses to {1C} opening](#-coping-with-interference-over-game-forcing-responses-to-1c-opening).

Otherwise, opener should bid {1NT} to ask responder to bid their singleton or void at the 2-level. (Note that if opener has a single-suited hand, it is likely that responder's shortness will be in that suit. Nonetheless, even if opener's suit is strong enough to play a contract in that suit opposite a singleton or void, they should still bid {1NT} because in the rare cases where responder's shortness is in another suit, prospects for slam have improved significantly.)

Following responder's shortness-showing bid, opener will make an asking bid:

- Bidding a suit other than responder's short suit at the cheapest level is a [suit-agreement bid](#-suit-agreement-bid) and asks for responder's control count.
- Bidding responder's short suit at the 3-level is also a [suit-agreement bid](#-suit-agreement-bid) - albeit more of an imposition than an agreement, given responder's shortness in the suit - and asks for responder's control count.
  - Note that opener will need a very strong suit to play opposite a singleton or void. Otherwise, they should prefer an NT contract.
- Bidding {2NT} is an [HCP range ask bid](#-nt-range-ask-bid) and asks for responder's HCP range.
