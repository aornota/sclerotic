## <a name="Non-game-forcing_responses_to_1C_opening_bid"> Non-game-forcing reponses to 1C opening bid

If opener's LHO passes after a {1C} opening bid and responder has 0-8 HCP, they should bid as follows:

- With no 7+ card suit, bid [{1D}](#-1d-response-to-1c-opening). This bid forces opener to make at least one more bid if opener's RHO passes.
- With a 7+ card suit, bid [the suit at the 3-level (or higher)](#-other-responses-to-1c-opening). This bid is not forcing.
