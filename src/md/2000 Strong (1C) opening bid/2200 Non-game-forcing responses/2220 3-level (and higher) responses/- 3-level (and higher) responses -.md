### <a name="3-level_(and_higher)_responses_to_1C_opening"> 3-level (and higher) responses to 1C opening

The {3C}, {3D}, {3H}, and {3S} responses to a {1C} opening bid shows a hand with 0-8 HCP and 7+ cards in the suit bid. These bids are not forcing.

If opener's RHO bids over this reponse, see [coping with interference over non-game-forcing responses to {1C} opening](#-coping-with-interference-over-non-game-forcing-responses-to-1c-opening).

// TODO-NMB: When to bid at the 4- or 5-level instead?...

_More (e.g. when to bid higher than the 3-level) coming soon..._
